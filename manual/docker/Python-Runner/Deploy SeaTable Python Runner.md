# Deploy SeaTable Python Runner

## Components

The execution of Python scripts in SeaTable requires the interaction of SeaTable with two other components. The functions of SeaTable, SeaTable FAAS Scheduler, and SeaTable Python Runner and their relationship are as follows:

* SeaTable: Provides the editor to create, save, import/export, and modify Python scripts. When a user clicks to run a script, SeaTable sends a requests to the SeaTable FAAS Scheduler.
* SeaTable FAAS Scheduler: Handles incoming requests from SeaTable, schedules tasks, and sends requests to the SeaTable Python Runner. Additionally, it saves and counts the results of script runs. As such, it is equivalent to a master node.
* SeaTable Python Runner: Runs the scripts as tasked by the FAAS Scheduler. When the SeaTable Python Runner receives a request, it downloads the script content and starts a Docker container to run the script. After script execution, the container is destroyed for data security. As such, it is equivalent to a worker node.

If SeaTable runs many Python scripts and timely script execution is essential, multiple Python Runners can be deployed with a load balance component distributing the load.

## Requirements

SeaTable FAAS Scheduler and SeaTable Python Runner require 2 cores and 4GB RAM. These resources are a minimum requirement. With rising numbers of executed Python scripts, the allocated resources should be upped.

It is strongly recommended to install SeaTable FAAS Scheduler and Python Runner on a separate host. Running these two components on the same machine as SeaTable is very likely to cause conflicts.

These instructions assume that no other services are installed on the host, especially no other services listening on port 80 and 443.

SeaTable FAAS Scheduler and Python Runner use Docker and Docker Compose. Docker must be 20.04 or more recent. Verify the installed Docker version using `docker --version`. If your version is too old, update following the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/).

## Setup

The SeaTable and SeaTable FAAS Scheduler host communicate via their hostnames.  For illustrative purposes, these deployment instructions use the hostnames ...

* cloud.seatable.com for SeaTable and
* faas.seatable.com for SeaTable FAAS Scheduler.



Additionally, the following assumptions and conventions are used in the rest of this document:

- SeaTable Server - SeaTable Developer Edition or SeaTable Enterprise Edition - was installed according to this manual.
- `/opt/seatable-python-runner` and `/opt/seatable-faas-scheduler` are the directories of the Python Runner and FAAS Scheduler, respectively. If you decide to put them in different directories - which you can - adjust all paths accordingly. 
- SeaTable FAAS Scheduler uses two [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) for persisting data generated in its database and SeaTable FAAS Scheduler Docker container. The volumes' [host paths](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volumes) are /opt/seatable-faas-scheduler/mysql-data and /opt/seatable-faas-scheduler/shared,  respectively.  It is not recommended to change these paths. If you do,  keep that in mind when following these instructions.
- All configuration and log files for SeaTable and the webserver Nginx are stored in the volume of the SeaTable FAAS Scheduler container.



## Setup of SeaTable Python Runner

### Downloading the Python Runner Package

Download the install package from [Github](https://github.com/seatable/seatable-admin-docs/releases) using wget and unzip the archive. Delete the ZIP file after unzipping. Using Python Runner version 2.0.2 as an example, this are the commands:

``` bash
cd /opt
wget https://github.com/seatable/seatable-admin-docs/releases/download/seatable-python-runner-2.0.2/seatable-python-runner-2.0.2.zip
unzip seatable-python-runner-2.0.2.zip
rm seatable-python-runner-2.0.2.zip
```



### Installing the Prerequisites

SeaTable's Python Runner uses some pip packages. Install pip first:

``` bash
# CentOS
sudo yum install python3-pip -y

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
```

Then install the pip packages:

```bash
cd /opt/seatable-python-runner
sudo pip3 install -r server_requirements.txt
```



### Downloading the Python Runner Docker Image

Pull the image for SeaTable's Python Runner from Docker Hub:

``` bash
docker pull seatable/python-runner:latest
```

You can find all versions of Python Runner images in [Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/seatable/python-runner/tags).



### Initializing Python Runner

Initialize the Python Runner by running the init script:

``` bash
sudo ./init.sh
```



### Modifying the Configuration File

Open the Python Runner's conf file in an editor and add the address of SeaTable's FAAS Scheduler to the configuration:

``` bash
cd /opt/seatable-python-runner/conf
nano seatable_python_runner_settings.py

```

Edit the configuration as follows:

``` py
SCHEDULER_URL = 'https://faas.seatable.com'  # The URL of seatable-faas-scheduler, if you use an IP address, please add http://
```

#### Limit access to memory (optional)

``` py
CONTAINER_MEMORY = '2g'  # Up to 2GB of memory
```

On Ubuntu or Debian hosts, You may see messages similar to the following when working with an image.

```
WARNING: Your kernel does not support swap limit capabilities. Limitation discarded.
```

This warning does not occur on RPM-based systems, which enable these capabilities by default.

You can set CONTAINER_MEMORY to empty to avoid this warning:

``` py
CONTAINER_MEMORY = ''
```

Or you can change some configuration on the host.

``` bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Add or modify following configuration

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1"
```

Save and quit, and update GRUB

``` bash
sudo update-grub
```

If your GRUB configuration file has incorrect syntax, an error occurs. In this case, repeat above steps.

The changes take effect when the system is rebooted.

Additionally, default memory limit is 2GB, if you don't want to limit container to access memory, you can set it to empty string. In this way, above update about GRUB is not necessary.

``` py
CONTAINER_MEMORY = ''
```

**Related Documentation**

* [docker runtime options with Memory](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#memory)
* [Kernel does not support warning](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#your-kernel-does-not-support-cgroup-swap-limit-capabilities)

#### Customize time zone (optional)

This feature requires runner packages on 2.0.3 and above, and runner image on 2.5.4 and above.

Add time zone item to the configuration, indicating that the time zone in runner contianer.

``` python
TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'
```

If not configured, the default is the system time zone, if the system time zone is not read, it is the UTC time zone.

If the version does not meet the requirements, the time zone is the UTC time zone.


#### Set script running timeout

``` py
SUB_PROCESS_TIMEOUT = 60 * 15  # 15 mins
```

If not configured, the default is 15 minutes


#### Other docker run options (optional)

This feature requires runner packages on 2.0.5 and above, and runner image on 2.5.4 and above, experimental, please edit carefully.

Add the following configuration to the configuration file to modify the parameters when starting the container, the options must be set in the form of `--<option name>=<value>`

``` python
OTHER_OPTIONS = []
```

For example, you need to modify the network that the container is connected to when it starts

``` py
OTHER_OPTIONS = [
  "--network=xxx"  # xxx needs to exist
]
```

For the specific meaning of each, see [the official docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#options)

### Starting SeaTable Python Runner

Start SeaTable Python Runner using the SH-script:

``` bash
cd /opt/seatable-python-runner
sudo ./start.sh
```

After the execution of the start script, the directory structure looks as follows:

```bash
$ tree /opt/seatable-python-runner/ -L 2
/opt/seatable-python-runner/
├── conf
│   ├── seatable_python_runner.ini
│   └── seatable_python_runner_settings.py
├── function.py
├── init.sh
├── logs
│   ├── seatable-python-runner.log
│   └── uwsgi.log
├── server_requirements.txt
├── settings.py
├── start.sh
├── stop.sh
└── uwsgi.ini

```

The stop command is as follows:

``` bash
sudo ./stop.sh
```

NOTE: The start and stop scripts are a collection of a series of operations, you can edit it according to your needs.



### Tweaking the Python Runner

#### uWSGI configuration

The SeaTable Python Runner uses uWSGI. uWSGI's configuration is saved in the INI-file `seatable_python_runner.ini` in `/opt/seatable-python-runner/conf`.

The default configuration for SeaTable Python Runner 2.0.2 is:

``` ini
[uwsgi]
http = :8080
wsgi-file = function.py
callable = app
process = 4
threads = 2
buffer-size = 65536
stats = 127.0.0.1:9191
daemonize = logs/uwsgi.log
disable-logging = false
procname-prefix = run-python
logformat = [%(ltime)] %(method) %(uri) => generated %(size) bytes in %(secs) seconds
```

NOTE: The configuration may look different for other versions of SeaTable Python Runner.



## Setup SeaTable FAAS Scheduler

### Installing Docker Compose

Scheduler uses Docker Dompose. Install the docker-compose package:

```bash
# CentOS
sudo yum install docker-compose -y

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y
```



### Downloading the FASS Scheduler Image

Pull the image for SeaTable's FAAS Scheduler from Docker Hub:

``` bash
docker pull seatable/seatable-faas-scheduler:latest
```

You can find all versions of SeaTable FAAS Scheduler images in the [Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/seatable/seatable-faas-scheduler/tags).



### Downloading and Modifying docker-compose.yml

Download the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) sample file to the FAAS Scheduler's directory and modify the file to fit your environment and settings:

```bash
mkdir /opt/seatable-faas-scheduler
cd /opt/seatable-faas-scheduler
wget -O "docker-compose.yml" "https://manual.seatable.io/docker/Python-Runner/docker-compose.yml"
nano docker-compose.yml
```

The following options must be modified:

* The password of MariaDB root (MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD and DB_ROOT_PASSWD)
* The use of Let's Encrypt for HTTPS (SEATABLE_FAAS_SCHEDULER_SERVER_LETSENCRYPT)
* The host name (SEATABLE_FAAS_SCHEDULER_SERVER_HOSTNAME)

Optional customizable option in the docker-compose.yml are:

* The ports of the container seatable-faas-scheduler
* The volume paths for the container db
* The volume paths for the container seatable-faas-scheduler
* The image tag of the SeaTable FAAS Scheduler version to install (image)

* The time zone (Optional)



### Initializing the Database

Initialize the database with the following command:

``` bash
cd /opt/seatable-faas-scheduler
docker-compose up
```

NOTE: You should run the above command in a directory with the `docker-compose.yml`.

Wait for a while. When you see `This is an idle script (infinite loop) to keep container running.`  in the output log, the database initialized successfully. Press keyboard `CTRL + C`  to return to the prompt.

The directory structure should now look as follows (slightly shortend):

``` text
$ tree /opt/seatable-faas-scheduler -L 2
/opt/seatable-faas-scheduler
├── docker-compose.yml
├── mysql-data
├── shared
│   ├── seatable-faas-scheduler
│   │   ├── conf     (configuration files)
│   │   ├── scripts  (script files)
│   │   └── logs     (log files)
│   ├── nginx-logs   (Nginx logs)
│   └── ssl          (SSL certificate)

```



### Modifying the Configuration File of the FAAS Scheduler

Being the middle component between the SeaTable server and the Python Runner, the FAAS Scheduler's configuration must be added the addresses of both.

Open the FAAS Scheduler's configuration file in a text editor:

``` bash
cd /opt/seatable-faas-scheduler/shared/seatable-faas-scheduler/conf
nano seatable_faas_scheduler_settings.py

```

Edit the configuration as follows:

``` py
# faas
RUNNER_URL = 'http://host.docker.internal:8080'        # Internal address of the Python Runner
FAAS_URL = ''                                          # Old parameter name for internal address of the Python Runner, is kept for compatability reasons

# seatable
DTABLE_WEB_SERVICE_URL = 'https://cloud.seatable.com'  # URL of SeaTable server
SEATABLE_FAAS_AUTH_TOKEN = '***'                       # Token to copy to SeaTable's configuration file

```



### Starting the FAAS Scheduler

Now start the SeaTable FAAS Scheduler in detached mode:

``` bash
docker-compose up -d
```

NOTE: You should run the above command in the directory with the `docker-compose.yml`.



### Modifying the Configuration File of SeaTable

Open SeaTable's `dtable_web_setttings.py` configuration file in a text editor to add the FAAS Scheduler's address:

``` bash
nano /opt/seatable/seatable-data/seatable/conf/dtable_web_settings.py
```

Paste the following lines in the configuration file, paste the token from the `seatable_faas_scheduler_settings.py` and modify the parameter SEATABLE_FAAS_URL:

``` py
# for seatable-faas
SEATABLE_FAAS_AUTH_TOKEN = '***'                        # Token from seatable_faas_scheduler_settings.py
SEATABLE_FAAS_URL = 'https://faas.seatable.com'         # URL of the SeaTable FAAS Scheduler
```



### Restarting SeaTable

For the modifications in the `dtable_web_settings.py` to take effect, restart the SeaTable server:

``` bash
docker exec -d seatable /shared/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh restart
```



### Testing

Create a simple Python script in SeaTable. The simplest is a hello world:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

If the output console prints "Hello World!", you have successfully configured SeaTable's Python script execution environment.



### More Configuration Options of Scheduler

If you set `SEATABLE_FAAS_SCHEDULER_SERVER_LETSENCRYPT` to `true` in "docker-compose.yml", the container would request a letsencrypt-signed SSL certificate for you automatically.

e.g.

```yml
  seatable-faas-scheduler:
    ...
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      ...
    environment:
      ...
      - SEATABLE_FAAS_SCHEDULER_SERVER_LETSENCRYPT=True  # Default is False. Whether to use let's encrypt certificate.
      - SEATABLE_FAAS_SCHEDULER_SERVER_HOSTNAME=demo.faas-scheduler.seatable.com  # Specifies your host name if https is enabled
```

**Note**：Since the nginx configuration file is only generated automatically when you run the container for the first time, you'd better set `SEATABLE_FAAS_SCHEDULER_SERVER_HOSTNAME=True` before executing the `docker-compose up -d` command for the first time.

If you want to use your own SSL certificate, you can refer to the following steps:

1. Upload the SSL certificate file to the Scheduler data directory : `/Your Scheduler data volume/ssl/`
2. Modify the nginx configuration file : `/Your Scheduler data volume/seatable-faas-scheduler/conf/nginx.conf`
3. Reload the Nginx configuration file：`docker exec -it seatable-faas-scheduler /usr/sbin/nginx -s reload`

e.g.

```nginx
  server {
      if ($host = demo.faas-scheduler.seatable.com) {
          return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
      }
      listen 80;
      server_name demo.faas-scheduler.seatable.com;
      return 404;
  }
  
  server {
      server_name demo.faas-scheduler.seatable.com;
  
      listen 443 ssl;
      ssl_certificate /shared/ssl/<your-ssl.cer>;
      ssl_certificate_key /shared/ssl/<your-ssl.key>;
  
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
      ......
```


## Python Runner and FAAS Scheduler FAQ

### If, for whatever reason, the installation fails, how to start from a clean state again?

Remove the directory `/opt/seatable-faas-scheduler` and start again.


### What's the reason for the following output in SeaTable's Python?

```
error: Internal Server Error.
at e/</< 
```

SeaTable cannot communicate with the FAAS Scheduler. Check the configuration and start the FAAS Scheduler via docker-compose.



### What's the reasons when the Hello World example to not complete and only outputting?

```
Running...
```

The FAAS Scheduler cannot communicate with the Python Runner. Check the configuration and start the FAAS Scheduler via the SH-script.



### The Let's Encrypt SSL certificate is about to expire, how do I renew it?

The SSL certificate shoud be renewed automatically 30 days prior to it expiration. If the automatic renewal fails, this command renews the certificate manually:

```
docker exec -it seatable-faas-scheduler /scripts/renew_cert.sh
```



### How to run Python Runner Package using non-root user

Assume that the runner user runs the package and the package has been downloaded to /root/seatable-python-runner-x.x.x.zip.

Create runner user and home directory.

```
# useradd runner -m
```

Since the package program needs to call docker, but the new user runner may not have permission to use docker, the verification method is as follows.

```
# su - runner       # Switch to runner user
$ docker version    # Try to call docker
```

If you see permission denied or similar words, the runner user cannot call docker, ctrl + D exit the current session, and then use the following command to make the runner join the docker user group.

```
# usermod -aG docker runner
```

After running, you can use the su command again to switch to retry whether you can call docker.

If you still need to deploy seatable-python-runner to the /opt directory, please switch back from user runner and execute the following command.

```
# unzip /root/seatable-python-runner-x.x.x.zip -d /opt
# chown runner:runner /opt/seatable-python-runner -R
```

Use the su command again to switch to the runner user.

```
# su - runner
$ cd /opt/seatable-python-runner
```

Then follow the documentation to continue setup and deployment.



### How to run script as non-root user inside Python Runner container

Please deploy version 2.0.2 or later of Python Runner package.

Suppose you want to run scripts as the runner user in the container.

First you need to determine the uid of the runner on the host using following command.

```
# id runner
uid=1000(runner) gid=1001(runner) groups=1001(runner),999(docker)
```

1000 is the uid of user runner and 1001 is the gid of group runner.

Edit file seatable_python_runner_settings.py.

``` bash
cd /opt/seatable-python-runner/conf
nano seatable_python_runner_settings.py
```

Add configurations as follows:

``` py
UID = '1000'
GID = '1001'
```

Save it and quit.

All completed and restart Python Runner Package.
