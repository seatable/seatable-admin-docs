# Clean Database

## Clean Database Records

Since version 1.2, we offer a command to clear records older than the retention period in the seatable database (the default database name is `dtable_db`).

```
$ docker exec -it seatable /bin/bash

$ seatable.sh python-env /opt/seatable/seatable-server-latest/dtable-web/manage.py clean_db_records
```

The following tables will be cleaned:

| Database table                 | Table description                                            | Retention period |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| activities                     | Aggregated log (based on operation_log) recording row creations, modifications, and deletions | > 30 days        |
| delete_operation_log           | High level log (based on operation_log) recording all row deletions | > 30 days        |
| dtable_notifications           | User notifications inside the bases                          | > 30 days        |
| dtable_snapshots               | Snapshots of bases that are not store in dtable-storage-server | > 365 days       |
| notifications_usernotification | User notifications on the home page                          | > 30 days        |
| operation_log                  | Low level log recording all operations                       | > 14 days        |
| session_log                    | Low level log recording all user sessions                    | > 30 days        |

## Database Backup (optional)

Before running `clean_db_records`, you can make a backup by a shell script. The following tables with many records will be excluded:

- operation_log
- delete_operation_log
- session_log
- activities

Example of the `database_backup.sh` backup shell scriptï¼š

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
db_host='<IP address of database>'
db_user='root'
db_name='dtable_db'
backup_dir='/opt/seatable/db-backups'

echo 'Start backing up the database'

mysqldump -h$db_host -u$db_user -p --opt $db_name \
  --ignore-table=$db_name.activities \
  --ignore-table=$db_name.delete_operation_log \
  --ignore-table=$db_name.operation_log \
  --ignore-table=$db_name.session_log \
  > $backup_dir/seatable.sql.`date +"%Y-%m-%d"`

echo 'Database backup succeeded'
```

Run the shell script:

```
$ ./database_backup.sh
Start backing up the database
Enter password: xxxxx
Database backup succeeded
```

## Clean operation_log records

When the base is modified, `dtable-server` automatically saves it to `dtable-storage-server` every 5 minutes. In order to prevent `dtable-server` failure before the base is saved to `dtable-storage-server`, resulting in base data loss, every time base is modified, an operation log will be recorded in the operation_log table.

Therefore, the operation_log table tends to be very large. Since version 4.1, we offer a command to clear the useless data in the operation_log table three days ago.

```
$ docker exec seatable /opt/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh python-env /opt/seatable/seatable-server-latest/dtable-web/manage.py clean_operation_log

```
