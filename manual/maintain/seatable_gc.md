# SeaTable GC

SeaTable uses storage de-duplication technology to reduce storage usage. The underlying data blocks will not be removed immediately after you delete a file or a base. As a result, the number of unused data blocks will increase on SeaTable server.

To release the storage space occupied by unused blocks, you have to run a **garbage collection** program to clean up unused blocks on your server.

## Configuration

Add following lines to `seafile.conf` to keep deleted files for only 60 days:

```
[history]
keep_days = 60
```

## Dry-run mode

To see how much garbage can be collected without actually removing any garbage, use the dry-run option:

```
seatable.sh gc --dry-run
```

The output should look like:

```

## Removing Garbage

Run a garbage collection program without adding --dry-run option to actually remove garbage block.

```
seatable.sh gc
```
