# dtable web settings

Note: You can also modify most of the config items via web interface. The config items are saved in database table (dtable_db/constance_config). They have a higher priority over the items in config files. If you want to disable settings via web interface, you can add `ENABLE_SETTINGS_VIA_WEB = False` to `dtable_web_settings.py`.

## Basic settings

```
# for dtable-server
## The private key is used to authenticate between DTable Web and DTable Server
## DTABLE_SERVER_URL is for telling DTable Web the DTable Server's URL
## DTABLE_SOCKET_URL is for telling DTable Web the web socket URL of DTable Server
DTABLE_PRIVATE_KEY = 'xxxxx'
DTABLE_SERVER_URL = 'https://seatable.yourdomain.com/dtable-server/'
DTABLE_SOCKET_URL = 'https://seatable.yourdomain.com/'

# The URL of dtable-web that for users to visit your SeaTable server
DTABLE_WEB_SERVICE_URL = 'https://seatable.yourdomain.com/'

# The help link URL
HELP_LINK = 'https://seatable.io/help/'

# The file server URL
FILE_SERVER_ROOT = 'https://seatable.yourdomain.com/seafhttp/'

```

If you changed your domain, the URLs in above settings must be changed accordingly.

        'anon': '5/minute',
        'user': '300/minute',
    },
    'UNICODE_JSON': False,
}

# Throttling whitelist used to disable throttle for certain IPs.
# e.g. REST_FRAMEWORK_THROTTLING_WHITELIST = ['127.0.0.1', '192.168.1.1']
# Please make sure `REMOTE_ADDR` header is configured in Nginx conf
REST_FRAMEWORK_THROTTLING_WHITELIST = []

```
