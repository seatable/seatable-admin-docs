The challenge arises when altering the database structure, such as adding new columns, renaming columns, or changing column types in a table containing hundreds of thousands of rows. In such cases, direct database storage proves inefficient.</p> <p>To address this issue, SeaTable opts to persist base data in JSON-files instead. While this JSON-based backend approach offers flexibility, it also imposes a limitation on base size.

Therefore, you should consider whether to backup the MariaDB database first and then the data directory, or vice versa. In general, there is no issue with a time difference between the database and data backup. However, if you have to choose, we recommend backing up the database first, followed by the data folder. Here's why:</p> <ul> <li>If you back up the data directory first, there's a risk that new objects referenced in the MariaDB database may not yet exist in the file system. This could potentially lead to problems, even resulting in base corruption.</li> <li>If you back up the database first, you can be confident that all entries in the database reference valid objects.</li> </ul> S3 Object storage instead of local storage <p>If you're using S3 Object Storage instead of local storage, the folders <code>storage-data</code> and <code>seafile-data</code> aren't stored on the local file system. Instead, all data is stored in four S3 buckets. Three buckets <code>fs</code>, <code>commits</code> and <code>blocks</code> contain assets from file/image column and <code>storage</code> contains the base data.</p> <p>A recommended backup method would be to implement an S3 sync with active versioning and lifecycle management.</p> Example of a S3 sync job with rclone <p>We have had positive experiences using these <code>rclone</code> parameters to synchronize buckets containing millions of objects and terabytes of data. Be sure to customize the command according to your bucket names and rclone configuration.</p> <pre><code>rclone sync source:bucket-name target:bucket-name \\\n    --config /opt/rclone.conf \\\n    --stats 30m \\\n    --stats-one-line \\\n    --stats-log-level NOTICE \\\n    --transfers=16 \\\n    --checkers=16 \\\n    --skip-links \\\n    --s3-no-check-bucket \\\n    --log-file=\"/opt/backup.log\" \\\n    --log-level=NOTICE\n    --size-only\n</code></pre> URL Change during restore <p>If you restore your SeaTable Server with a new URL, don't forget to execute the command line tool to update the URL. Otherwise assets from the image and file columns will not be accessable.</p> Take care to take over the PLUGINS_REPO_ID <p>During the initial startup of the SeaTable container, SeaTable writes a variable called <code>PLUGIN_REPO_ID</code> to <code>dtable_web_settings.py</code>. This variable represents a hidden library that stores the installation files of the SeaTable plugins. If you delete (commenting is not sufficient) this value from the configuration file, SeaTable will generate a new value upon the next start.</p> <p>When performing a migration or restore, you have two options: you can either retain the existing value, ensuring that this repository exists in dtable-storage, or you can delete the value from <code>dtable_web_settings.py</code> and allow SeaTable to create a new one.</p>"},{"location":"maintenance/backup-recovery/#restore","title":"Restore","text":"<p>To restore your server, simply install a fresh new SeaTable Server and then import the mariadb dumps and copy all the user data.</p>"},{"location":"maintenance/backup-recovery/#restore-the-databases","title":"Restore the databases","text":"<pre><code># replace &lt;your_mysql_password&gt; with your actual MySQL password (might be still present in /opt/seatable-compose/.env)\n# beware that this method will expose your mysql password in the process list and shell history of the docker host\n\ndocker exec -i \"mariadb\" \"/usr/bin/mariadb\" -u\"root\" -p'&lt;your_mysql_password&gt;' ccnet_db &lt; /opt/seatable-backup/ccnet_db.sql\ndocker exec -i \"mariadb\" \"/usr/bin/mariadb\" -u\"root\" -p'&lt;your_mysql_password&gt;' seafile_db &lt; /opt/seatable-backup/seafile_db.sql\ndocker exec -i \"mariadb\" \"/usr/bin/mariadb\" -u\"root\" -p'&lt;your_mysql_password&gt;' dtable_db &lt; /opt/seatable-backup/dtable_db.sql\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"maintenance/backup-recovery/#restore-the-seatable-data-and-deployment-settings","title":"Restore the SeaTable data and deployment settings","text":"<p>Simply copy all files back to their original position.</p> <pre><code>rsync -az /opt/seatable-backup/seatable /opt/seatable-server\nrsync -az /opt/seatable-backup/seatable-compose /opt\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"maintenance/backup-recovery/#restore-the-dtable-db-data","title":"Restore the dtable-db data","text":"<p>To restore the big data, you can execute the following command.
