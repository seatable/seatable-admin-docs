# Backup And Recovery

## Overview

There are generally two parts of data to backup

* SeaTable tables data
* Databases

If you setup SeaTable server according to our manual, you should have a directory layout like:

```
/Your SeaTable data volume/seatable/
├── ccnet
├── conf
├── db-data
├── logs
├── pids
├── scripts
├── seafile-data
├── seafile-license.txt
├── seahub-data
└── storage-data

```

All your data is stored under the `/Your SeaTable data volume/seatable/` directory. Below are important sub-directories that contain user data:

* seafile-data: contains uploaded files for file and image columns
* seahub-data: contains data used by web front-end, such as avatars
* db-data: contains archived rows in bases
* storage-data: contains backups for the bases in dtable-db (added in Enterprise Edition 3.0.0); Since version 3.0.0, tables and snapshots are also stored in this directory.

SeaTable also stores some important metadata data in a few databases.

MySQL databases:

* ccnet_db: contains user and group information
* seafile_db: contains library metadata
* dtable_db: contains tables used by the web front end

??? info "Database structure"

    SeaTable stores the following data types in the SQL database in the `seatable-mysql` Docker container:

    * user actions and inputs in bases (e.g. new/modified/deleted rows, new/modified/deleted columns, new/modified, deleted views)
    * meta-information for bases (e.g. API-token, common datasets, links, row comments, snapshots, third-party accounts, webhooks)
    * statistical and log information (e.g. automation rules execution, row count)
    * user and group information (e.g. 2FA status, logins, user quota)
    * versioning information for the assets (e.g. files and images) saved in bases

## Backup

### Steps

1. Backup the MySQL databases;
2. Backup the SeaTable data directory;

Backup Order: Database First or Data Directory First

### Backing up Database

```
# It's recommended to backup the database to a separate file each time. Don't overwrite older database backups for at least a week.
cd /opt/seatable-backup/databases
docker exec -it seatable-mysql mysqldump -uroot -pMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --opt ccnet_db > ccnet_db.sql
docker exec -it seatable-mysql mysqldump -uroot -pMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --opt seafile_db > seafile_db.sql
docker exec -it seatable-mysql mysqldump -uroot -pMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --opt dtable_db > dtable_db.sql

```

### Backing up SeaTable data

You can use rsync to do incremental backup for data directories (assuming /opt/seatable-backup/ already exists)

  ```bash
  rsync -az --exclude 'ccnet' --exclude 'logs' --exclude 'db-data' /opt/seatable/seatable-data/seatable /opt/seatable-backup/seatable
  ```

You may notice that `db-data` directory is not backed up. The data in this directory is backed up in a different way. Please refer to the next sub-section.

#### Setup automatic backup for dtable-db

_available since Enterprise Edition 3.0.0_

Data managed by dtable-db component is archived rows from bases. They should be backed up as well. Data for dtable-db sits in the `/opt/seatable/seatable-data/seatable/db-data` directory.

Unlike other components, dtable-db provides built-in automatic backup mechanism. It will take a snapshot for each base and upload to dtable-storage-server. dtable-db only make new backup for a base if it detects changes to it. This makes the backup more efficient. dtable-storage-server also compresses the backups to make it more storage-efficient.

To setup automatic backup for dtable-db:

1. Setup and run dtable-storage-server. It should be started by default. Find more details in [dtable-storage-server documentation](../config/dtable_storage_server_conf.md).
2. Set `[backup]` configuration options in dtable-db.conf as in [dtable-db documentation](../config/dtable_db_conf.md)

If you configure dtable-storage-server with local file system as backend, dtable-storage-server saves its data to the path specified in dtable-storage-server.conf. By default it's set to `/opt/seatable/seatable-data/seatable/storage-data`. If you set up your backup as in the last section, you should have already backed up this directory as well. Since storage-data directory has already contained the backups for dtable-db, data in db-data directory doesn't need to backup.

If you configure dtable-storage-server with object storage as backend, there will be no data saved to `/opt/seatable/seatable-data/seatable/storage-data`. So you don't have to backup storage-data directory either.

You can also manually execute the command to backup dtable-db data immediately

```
docker exec -it seatable /opt/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh backup-all
```

## Recovery

### Restore the databases

```
docker exec -i seatable-mysql /usr/bin/mysql -uroot -pMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD ccnet_db < /opt/seatable-backup/databases/ccnet_db.sql
docker exec -i seatable-mysql /usr/bin/mysql -uroot -pMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD seafile_db < /opt/seatable-backup/databases/seafile_db.sql
docker exec -i seatable-mysql /usr/bin/mysql -uroot -pMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD dtable_db < /opt/seatable-backup/databases/dtable_db.sql

```

### Restore the SeaTable data

```
rsync -az /opt/seatable-backup/seatable /opt/seatable/seatable-data/seatable

```

### Restore the dtable-db data

```
docker exec -it seatable /opt/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh restore-all
```
