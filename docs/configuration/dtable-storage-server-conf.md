# DTable Storage Server config

DTable storage server provides persistent storage for bases and backup service for dtable-db. It supports file system, S3 storage backends. This component is added in version 3.0.

## Configuration example

```
[general]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 6666
log_dir = .
temp_file_dir = ./tmp

[storage backend]
type = filesystem
path = /path/to/storage

[snapshot]
interval = 86400
keep_days = 180
```

## Configuration

### general

In `[general]` section:

- `host`: The address that dtable-storage-server listens on. Default is `127.0.0.1`.
- `port`: The port that dtable-storage-server listens on. Default is `6666`.
- `log_dir`: The directory that dtable-storage-server writes logs to. Default is the dir of configuration file.
- `temp_file_dir`: The directory that dtable-storage-server create buffers in. _Required_

### Storage backend

In `[storage backend]` section:

- `type`: The type of storage backend. Options are `filesystem`, and `s3`. Default is `filesystem`.

For filesystem storage backend:

- `path`: The filepath of storage backend.

For S3 storage backend:

- `bucket`: The bucket name of S3 backend.
- `key_id`: The access key id of S3 backend.
- `key`: The access key of S3 backend.
- `use_v4_signature`: Whether to use v4 signature. For a S3-compatible storage, it should be `false`.
- `aws_region`: The region of S3 backend. (only when v4 signature is used)
- `host`: The host address of S3 backend. Required for S3-compatible storage. Optional for AWS S3, but can be set to the endpoint you use.
- `path_style_request`: Whether to use path style requests. For a S3-compatible storage, it should be `true`.
- `use_https`: Whether to use https.
- `sse_c_key`: Use server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C).

`sse_c_key` is a string of 32 characters.

You can generate `sse_c_key` with the following commandï¼š

```
openssl rand -base64 24
```

!!! warning "Incompatibility with Ceph-based object storage"

    Please note that certain object storage providers that are based on Ceph (e.g. Hetzner Object Storage) currently do not support `CopyObject` operations when using SSE-C. This makes them incompatible with SeaTable. There is an [open issue](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/23264) over at the Ceph issue tracker.

### `[snapshot]`

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                | Default |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `interval`            | The interval for generating snapshots of a base, if there are changes to the base. Unit is in seconds.                                                                                     | 86400   |
| `enable_cleanup`      | Controls snapshot cleanup. Activate on only one node in multi-server setups.                                                                                                               | true    |
| `keep_days`           | Specifies the snapshot retention period in days. Older snapshots are deleted. As of version 5.2, the default is 180 days; previously, it was unlimited (0).                                | 180     |
| `keep_frequency_days` | Specifies daily snapshot period for changed bases. After this, only one snapshot per month is kept. Default is 0 (always daily). Requires keep_days to be set and > `keep_frequency_days`. | 0       |

!!! warning "Example of new tiered snapshot retention"

    By default, it creates daily snapshots for changed bases, deleting snapshots older than 180 days.

    Since version 5.2, SeaTable offers a tiered retention strategy for snapshots. This approach balances recent, detailed backups with efficient long-term storage.
    For example, setting `keep_days = 180` and `keep_frequency_days = 7` would retail:

    - Daily snapshots for the past week
    - Monthly snapshots for the past six months, except for the past week.
