# dtable web settings

The `dtable_web_settings.py` is one of the central configuration files of SeaTable. With this file you can configure a lot of settings and functions of the web interface of SeaTable. The `dtable_web_settings.py` consists of a list of `Key = Value` pairs. Comments starting with `#` are ignored. 

You need to restart SeaTable so that your changes take effect. Just execute the following command at your command line.

```bash
docker exec -d seatable /shared/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh restart

```

You can also modify some of the config items as system administrator via web interface. These config items are saved in the database table (dtable_db/constance_config). The configuration in the database has a higher priority then the items in config file. If you want to disable settings via web interface, you can add `ENABLE_SETTINGS_VIA_WEB = False` to `dtable_web_settings.py`.

## Basic settings
