# SeaTable Changelog

SeaTable, as a dynamic platform, undergoes frequent updates and enhancements to provide users with the best possible experience. To keep our users informed about these changes, we maintain several changelogs:

## Functions

For a comprehensive overview of updates to the SeaTable Server, users can refer to our detailed changelog available at [SeaTable Server Changelog](https://seatable.com/changelog/). Here, they can explore the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes implemented in each release, ensuring they stay up-to-date with the platform's evolution.

## Blog with Release Notes

In addition to the detailed changelogs mentioned above, we curate a blog featuring [release notes](https://seatable.com/blog/) that highlight the most significant changes in each version. This narrative-style format provides users with a concise yet informative overview of key updates, allowing them to quickly grasp the impactful enhancements introduced in a particular release. You can explore our blog at SeaTable Release Notes Blog.

## New API Calls

As the SeaTable API evolves to meet the changing needs of our users and developers, we document all new API calls and changes in our [API Changelog](https://api.seatable.io/reference/changelog). This resource, available at SeaTable API Changelog, provides developers with insights into the latest API updates, enabling them to leverage new functionalities and enhancements in their integrations and applications.

## Extra Upgrade Notices

In addition to general changelogs, we provide specific [upgrade notices](../upgrade/extra-upgrade-notice.md) containing changes relevant to administrators. These notices highlight critical updates, potential impact on system configurations, and any necessary actions to ensure smooth transitions during upgrades.
