# Introduction to SeaTable Server Installation

SeaTable is the world leading self hosted no-code platform. You can run SeaTable on consumer or enterprise-grade hardware and a variety of operating systems and architectures. The installation always uses Docker and the docker compose plugin. This guide outlines the installation process for SeaTable Server (Enterprise and Developer Edition) on a Linux OS using Docker.

Our goal is to offer a straightforward installation method that results in a fully operational SeaTable system accessible via HTTPS within minutes. While the steps have been tested on Debian and Ubuntu-based systems, they should also work on other Linux server systems. The installation is executed via the command line as the `root` user.
