# dtable-db Standalone

To improve scalability and reliability, the next step is to move `dtable-db` to its own dedicated node.

![SeaTable Cluster: dtable-db standalone](../../assets/images/seatable-cluster-dtable-db-standalone.png)

## Setting Up a Standalone dtable-db Server

Prepare a new node with Docker installed, and copy the following files from your first node to this new node:

- `/opt/seatable-compose/.env`
- `/opt/seatable-compose/seatable-license.txt`

Open the `.env` file on the new node and ensure that the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable references only a single YAML file, like this:

```
COMPOSE_FILE='dtable-db.yml'
```

### Create `dtable-db.yml`

Now, create the `dtable-db.yml` file. You can either copy `dtable-web.yml` from the first node or use `seatable-server.yml` from the SeaTable release as a template.

Apply the following required changes to this file:

??? success "Remove all services except seatable-server"

    The `dtable-db` node only requires the `seatable-server` service. Remove all other services (such as redis, mariadb, or caddy).

??? success "Remove all labels"

    Since `dtable-db` node does not require Caddy or any TLS termination, remove all labels from the `seatable-server` service.

??? success "Add additional environment variables"

    Add or update the following environment variables to ensure only `dtable-db` is enabled:

    ```
    environment:
      #... all default environment variables in seatable-server.yml ...
      # this node should only run dtable-db, all other services are disabled
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_DB=true                # that is, what we want
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_STORAGE_SERVER=true    # required for big data backup
      - ENABLE_SEAFILE_SERVER=false
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_WEB=false
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_SERVER=false
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_EVENTS=false
      - ENABLE_API_GATEWAY=false
      - SEATABLE_START_MODE=cluster          # Don't run any database update processes
    ```

??? success "Expose port 7777"

    The `dtable-db` node must be accessible to other nodes. Add the following to the `seatable-server` service:

    ```
    ports:
      - 7777:7777
    ```

??? success "Configure internal network communication"

    Node-to-node communication uses the internal network. Ensure all nodes can reach each other by adding their names and private IP addresses:

    ```
    extra_hosts:
      - "dtable-web:10.0.0.2"
      - "dtable-db:10.0.0.3"
    ```

For reference, here is an example of what your `dtable-db.yml` might look like (do not copy and paste directly â€” adapt as needed):

```
---
services:
  seatable-server:
    image: ${SEATABLE_IMAGE:-seatable/seatable-enterprise:x.x.x}
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: seatable-server
    volumes:
      - "/opt/seatable-server:/shared"
      - type: bind
        source: "./seatable-license.txt"
        target: "/shared/seatable/seatable-license.txt"
        read_only: ${SEATABLE_LICENSE_FORCE_READ_ONLY:-false}
    environment:
      ...
      ...
      # this node should only run dtable-db
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_DB=true
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_STORAGE_SERVER=true
      - ENABLE_SEAFILE_SERVER=false
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_WEB=false
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_SERVER=false
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_EVENTS=false
      - ENABLE_API_GATEWAY=false
      - SEATABLE_START_MODE=cluster
    ports:
      - 7777:7777
    extra_hosts:
      - "dtable-web:10.0.0.2"
      - "dtable-db:10.0.0.3"
    networks:
      - frontend-net
networks:
  frontend-net:
    name: frontend-net
```

Now, start dtable-db for the first time and monitor the logs:

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Changes after first start

After the first start of `dtable-db` you need to make the following changes to newly created configuration files:

??? success "Add S3 configuration"

    Add the S3 configuration to `conf/dtable-storage-server.conf - analog to your first node. 

??? success "Two additional configuration changes"

    Open `conf/dtable-db.conf` and make these two changes:

    - set `host` to 0.0.0.0 that other nodes can reach dtable-db.
    - add `[dtable cache]` to tell `dtable-db` where to find `dtable-server`.

    ```
    [general]
    host = 0.0.0.0

    [dtable cache]
    dtable_server_url = "http://dtable-web:5000"
    ```

### Verify installation on dtable-db

Now it is time to restart dtable-db and verify that the service is running and port 7777 is exposed. Simply run:

```
curl 127.0.0.1:7777/ping/
```

You should receive the following response:

```
{"ret":"pong"}
```

## Tell dtable-web where to find dtable-db

Now that dtable-db is up and running, it is time to tell dtable-web to use this separate node instead of the internal component. 
These are the changes, you have to do.

??? success "Disable dtable-db in `.env`"

    Open `/opt/seatable-compose/dtable-web.yml` and make these changes:

    ```
    environment:
      - ENABLE_DTABLE_DB=false
      - SEATABLE_START_MODE=first
    extra_hosts:
      - "dtable-web:10.0.0.2"
      - "dtable-db:10.0.0.3"
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    ```

??? success "Create configuration file for the API-Gateway"

    Create a new configuration file `conf/dtable-api-gateway.conf` and add these lines to tell this node, where to find `dtable-db`

    ```
    [dtable-db]
    server_address = "http://dtable-db:7777"
    ```

??? success "Update `dtable_web_settings.py`"

    Open the configuration file `/conf/dtable_web_settings.py` and add this line:

    ```
    INNER_DTABLE_DB_URL = 'http://dtable-db:7777/'
    ```

??? success "Update `dtable_server_config.json`"

    Open the configuration file `conf/dtable_server_config.json` and add this line. Make sure, that it is valid json, meaning the last key-value pair, does not have a comma at the end.

    ```
    "dtable_db_service_url": "http://dtable-db:7777"
    ```

### Restart dtable-web server

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Verify complete setup 

A good way to verify, that the two nodes are working fine, is to ppen a universal app in the webinterface. You should see log entries on `dtable-db` in `/logs/dtable-db-access.log`.

Congratulations. dtable-db is now standalone.
