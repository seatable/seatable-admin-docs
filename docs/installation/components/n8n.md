# Automation platform n8n

SeaTable empowers users and teams to store, manage, and visualize structured data efficiently, offering multiple data input options from manual entry to web forms and a comprehensive API. This flexibility ensures seamless data collection while allowing users to define automated workflows with triggers and actions.

## Installation

This article shows you how to install **n8n** (Community Edition) on your SeaTable server.

#### Change the .env file

Like with all additional components you first have to add the `n8n.yml` to the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in your `.env` file.

Simply copy and paste (:material-content-copy:) the following code into your command line:

```bash
sed -i "s/COMPOSE_FILE='\(.*\)'/COMPOSE_FILE='\1,n8n.yml'/" /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

#### Generate secrets for your postgres database

Now let's create inital secrets and write them into the .env file.

```
echo -e "\n# n8n" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
echo "N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(pwgen -s 40 1)" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(pwgen -s 40 1)" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
echo "POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(pwgen -s 40 1)" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

#### Start n8n

Now it is time to start n8n for the first time.

```bash
cd /opt/seatable-compose && \
docker compose up -d
```

**Congratulations!** Your n8n server is ready to use.

## Initial setup

#### Create initial admin user

To set up your initial admin user, n8n offers a convenient Web UI accessible at `https://<your-seatable-server-hostname>:6231`.

Please note that the Community Edition of n8n only permits the creation of multiple accounts with just one admin account. Further details regarding the features of this version will be elaborated later in this article.

## Limitations of the Community Edition of n8n

The installed n8n version on this server is the self-hosted free Community Edition, which aligns with the **Starter Cloud version**.

It offers:

However, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- Only one admin account is allowed
