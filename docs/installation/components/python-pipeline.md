# Python Pipeline

To run Python scripts directly within SeaTable, you need to install the Python Pipeline â€” an environment utilizing Docker containers for script execution and result retrieval. Thanks to SeaTable's Python API, querying and manipulating data in a SeaTable base is super easy.

Explore various use cases from other SeaTable users:

- Retrieve current stock prices and store them in SeaTable.
- Validate DNS settings of specified domains for specific TXT entries.
- Capture submissions from form.io and store the results.
- Identify duplicate entries and apply specific tags.

Find additional Python functions and code examples in the [SeaTable Developer Manual](https://developer.seatable.io).

## Installation

This how-to explains the deployment of the Python Pipeline next to your SeaTable Server instance.

#### Amend the .env file

To install the Python Pipeline, append `python-pipeline.yml` to the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable within your `.env` file. This instructs Docker to download the required images for the Python Pipeline.

Simply copy and paste (:material-content-copy:) the following code into your command line:

```bash
sed -i "s/COMPOSE_FILE='\(.*\)'/COMPOSE_FILE='\1,python-pipeline.yml'/" /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

!!! warning "Avoid space in `COMPOSE_FILE`"

    When manually adding `python-pipeline.yml` to the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable using your preferred text editor, make sure that you do not enter a space (:material-keyboard-space:). After the modification, your `COMPOSE_FILE` variable should look like this:

    ```bash
    COMPOSE_FILE='caddy.yml,seatable-server.yml,python-pipeline.yml'
    ```

#### Generate a shared secret for secure communication

For secure communication between SeaTable and the Python Pipeline, a shared secret is required to prevent unauthorized access or usage. We recommend utilizing `pwgen` to generate a robust and secure password. Copy and paste the following command into your command line to generate a password:

```bash
pw=$(pwgen -s 40 1) && echo "Generated shared secret: ${pw}"
```

The generated shared secret needs to be added to your `.env` file. Copy and paste the following command:

```bash
echo -e "\n# python-pipeline" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
echo "PYTHON_SCHEDULER_AUTH_TOKEN=${pw}" >> /opt/seatable-compose/.env
```

#### Start the Python Pipeline

Now it is time to start the Python Pipeline.

```bash
cd /opt/seatable-compose && \
docker compose up -d && \
docker exec -d seatable-server /shared/seatable/scripts/seatable.sh restart
```

#### Check the functionality Python Pipeline

Do you want to execute your first Python script in SeaTable? Nothing easier than that.

- Login to your SeaTable Server.
- Create a new base and open it.
- Add a Python script with the content `print("Hello World")` and execute it. If you don't know how to do this, check out our [user manual](https://seatable.io/docs/javascript-python/anlegen-und-loeschen-eines-skriptes/?lang=auto).

If everything went well, you should see the output `Hello World`.

:material-party-popper: **Great!** Your SeaTable Server instance can now run Python scripts.
